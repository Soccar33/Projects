   <h1 class="two">All About Me</h1>
    <p class="one">This summer, I started lawn mowing for neighbors and got my own job. This winter, I started shoveling too and now after learning how to make a website from school, I can run my own buisness and earn money. My friends and I do this to help others in need and keep us off technology. We shovel, mow lawns, and help with yardwork. So if you ever need anything, contact us.  </p>
